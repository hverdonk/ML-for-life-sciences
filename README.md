# Machine Learning Fundamentals Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that cover fundamental concepts in machine learning, including numerical derivatives, matrix operations, and logistic regression training. The notebooks were provided as a series of exercises in the seminar series "Machine Learning for the Life Sciences," presented by Dr. Vincenzo Carnevale at Temple University in Spring 2023.

## Notebooks

1. **2_Foundations_NumpyDerivativesQ.ipynb**  
   - Introduction to numerical derivatives using NumPy.  
   - Basic differentiation techniques for machine learning applications.  

2. **3_Foundations_NumpyDerivatives&MatrixNEW.ipynb**  
   - Extended coverage of numerical differentiation.  
   - Introduction to matrix operations relevant to machine learning.  

3. **4_Fundamentals_LR.ipynb**  
   - Fundamentals of logistic regression.  
   - Implementation and theory behind logistic regression.  

4. **5_Fundamentals_LRTraining.ipynb**  
   - Training logistic regression models.  
   - Optimization techniques and convergence analysis.  

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter
```

## Usage
